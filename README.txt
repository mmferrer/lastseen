Since we're starting from scratch, here's the new project.
A couple of things to remember:

Tasks:
1. Marky
	- Submission page
	- Comments section
	- Maps

2. Kevin
	- User accounts
	- Login/logout and signup
	- Profile page

3. Clyde
	- Homepage
		- Connecting everything together
		- try


Note:
	- admin.py has not been setup (DO THIS FIRST - EXCEPT FOR HOMEPAGE)
	- urls.py has not been setup
	- focus on functionality and use basic html forms - design comes after everything
	  has been completed
	- template folders has not been set (Clyde, please figure this one out) 

HOW TO MAKE THE DATABASE WORK:
	- delete the database file
	- do a syncdb
	- enter the necessary details (username and password, I didn't put any email on mine)

IMPORTANT!!!
	- always place meaningful comments whenever you commit
	- never forget to always push after working so we can review the changes afterwards
